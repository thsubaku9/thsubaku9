# About Me

- **ðŸ¥¸ Hobbyist Developer**  
  I enjoy building things for fun and learning.

- **Favorite Languages**  
  I primarily use Go and Python for most of my projects.

- **ðŸ”­ Projects of Interest**  
  I wrote the paper `Cantor-Mapping` and working on projects like `go-interpreter`, `go-beaver`, and `go-rattata`. I also tackle dsa and paste my solutions at [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/u/LeKuskusJ) 

- **Thoughts on Hackathons**  
  Iâ€™m not a fan of hackathons. The intense pace can lead to burnout, and I prefer a more sustainable approach to coding (maybe Iâ€™m just not an adrenaline junkie).

- **Fun Fact**  
  I am both ambidextrous and ambipedal (which probably helps explain my high degree of neuroplasticity) (or maybe its the other way around)
